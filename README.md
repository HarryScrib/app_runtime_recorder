# Application Monitor - A Project Undertaking

## Overview

I tried to create a small application that would allow me to monitor runtime for everything I open and use on my desktop throughout the day. 
The goal was to be able to have a small overlay that I could sit on the top corner of my screen, and at a glance I'd be able to see if I'm essentially procrastinating too much.

The application aimed to:

Detect every program that is being used on the computer throughout the day.
Catalogue how much time each of those programs has been used as the main focus application in a day - ie actively using, and not just open in the background.
Create progress bars that would be able to remind or prompt me that a program was being used excessively as they would change to a bright red.
Ideally, I wanted to implement some spreadsheet functionality whereby I could properly analyse the data over longitudinal collected sessions, but this was never going to be included in an initial build.

In general, I just wanted to create something small for reinforcing what I believe are good habits.

## My Experience

For the sake of context, I am a fledgling programmer. I do not have a large wealth of experience in this space, and programming is something I have picked up recently through online courses.
I gave myself a week (5 working days) to build this project from scratch. This was my first ever project, and I was not able to complete what I had set out.
I would find myself using up a lot of hours trying to tie things together as I had no experience in User Interface libraries or their application.
When creating classes that would interact with one another, I was having some difficulty getting things to conjoin with one another whilst executing the expected outcome. A lot of trial and error was necessary.
Overall it was a really fun and frusatrating undertaking, and even though I don't have much to show for it, I learnt a lot.
I had 5 .py files, of which I've deleted 4 of them, and have attached the cleanest part of what I've built for this commit. 
I'd like to try this again at a later date, when I know a bit more about what I'm doing.

## Going Forward

For now I'm going to have to pull my ambitions back an awful lot and go with something a lot more basic. Something where I can work more on the logic of the coding, and spend less time googling complete unknown areas.

It is currently 07/11/2023 (UK, so November).
I am going to try to build 3 or 4 projects to completion by the time the month is over, starting with a calculator.
